Syndicate RPG is a (RPG) gamemode for Garry's Mod featuring over 35,000 lines of Lua code. After being released commercially in 2016, it is now free to download!

If you use this, I would appreciate you buying the **credit shop** addon [here](https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/3915) - once hooked up to a donation system of your choice, your players will be able to purchase special items such as Weapon/Armor Reset Stones, crafting handbooks, ect.

I also recommend you to look at my other addon - [GTerminal](https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/gterminal-advanced-darkrp-hacking-module)

If you don't want to do that but still want to help, please **Star** the repo.

## Features

**Equipment** - Players can equip and dequip armors and weapons from their inventory. Once they do this, the attributes from the item will be applied to them. (Eg extra health, fire/ice damage ect)

**Armor** - Once the player crafts armor, they can equip it and it will update their model & give them the attributes of the armor. All armors are upgradable using any armor upgrades gathered in game. There are currently 5 separate armor sets in the game, all of which can be mixed and matched

**Crafting** - Once a player accquires a blueprint and crafting materials, they can begin crafting using the Blacksmith NPC. If a player crafts a weapon or armor, the items level will be randomly chosen, along with its class and upgrade slots. Players can increase this level using items in the game

**Buildings** - Once players buy a door in a building, they will own it and be charged the rent for that individual building. Other players will be able to use a buildings capture point to control it. Whatever map, it's simple to configure buildings to work with this gamemode. Just walk up to a door, press F2 and set the building. Then use the admin power, capture point and cash spawn tools to configure the building spawns. You can then go into the F4 menu and set the rent of the building.

**F4 & F1 Menus** - Both fully custom & feature beautiful GUI. The F4 menu is the main hub of the game. Players can join/create gangs from here, buy items such as material forges and printers, check their achievements, spawn their cars, and much more. The F1 menu gives your players a link to your site / the wiki for the game, making it easy for them to learn how to play

**NLR** - The gamemode features an NLR system where players will spawn as a ghost for an amount of time after they die. The time depends on the level of the player

**Gangs** - Gangs are a large part of the gamemode. Players can start gangs from level 10 and invite other players to join them. They can start rivalries with other gangs and fight for territories around the map. Once a gang has levelled up enough, members can buy special gang-only items such as gang unarrest sticks & gang printer coolers. Gang leaders can also buy upgrades for the gang, such as more health for their members, or an XP boost.

**Supports M9K and FAS:2** - For if you want to add your own weapons

**Language Support** - Uses DarkRP's translations, you can translate every phrase in the game through a file

**Supports DarkRP addons** - The gamemode works with all addons created for DarkRP, enabling you to customize your server even more!

It is recommended you use a MySQL database for this gamemode, but it should work without one too.

## Installation
 1. Install DarkRP - this gamemode is derived from it
 2. Drag the gamemode to your gamemodes folder
 3. Copy `/syndicate/gamemode/config/config-default.lua` to `config.lua` so your config changes are not overridden every time you update.
 4. Edit the settings in `config.lua` - the defaults will work too
 5. Edit /syndicate/gamemode/config/mysql.lua with your MySQL settings
 6. Start and join your server, type 'fadmin setroot <yourname>' into the console to make yourself admin
 7. Press F4, go to admin, and setup your territories, spawns and buildings
 8. Use the admin tools to configure power sockets, capture points and cash spawns
 6. Done!

## Tips

 - Don't rename the gamemode to something else or you will get less players - since servers are grouped by gamemode
 - If you wish to rename the gamemode to DarkRP so it shows under DarkRP, do the following: http://i.imgur.com/VjdSdy4.png and also change "darkrp" to "darkrpx" in darkrpx.txt
 
 - Don't give yourself items/levels/ect, because if you do then players won't want to put time into getting things you got for nothing
